A personally tried-and-test curated list of software tools that worked best in merging data analytics skills with IT consulting career


# Data Science toolkit for IT Consultants

Working as a Consultant in project management and business analysis, I help clients with solutions to their business challenges.

In recent years my work has significantly shifted from tech-infrastructure to data driven initiatives. That's when I started to learn Data Science. Did Moocs, read books, tutorials and tried a lot of open source software - basically got acquainted with quite a lot of theory, tools and languages.

This list is the crux of my effort. I've curated list of software that worked best for me in merging data analytics skillset with my consulting career.

If you're in IT, project management, telco or consulting like me, this list will hopefully help you too. 

On my end, my learning isn't over - reckon I've just got myself addicted to machine learning (finished top 15% in my first Kaggle competition and just bought a GPU machine), I will be adding to this list all other stuff including training and books that worked best for me.

So stay tuned and meanwhile, if you feel something could be improved, please feel free to make any contribution. Just send me a pull request or simply connect on LinkedIn.
